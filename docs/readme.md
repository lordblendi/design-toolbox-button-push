# Design Toolbox Button and Push

Button and Push components of the TenForce design toolbox.

## CSS

This component is using [one](https://github.com/tenforce/design-toolbox-button-push/blob/master/docs/sass/toolbox-button.scss) CSS file. The design for both buttons and pushes are the same. One is a button and the other one is an anchor element.

## HTML structure

The Design documentation was built in Jekyll using SASS and Liquid.

- Structure for the button with comments in Jekyll can be found [here](https://github.com/tenforce/design-toolbox-button-push/blob/master/docs/_includes/components/toolbox-button.html).
- Structure for the push with comments in Jekyll can be found [here](https://github.com/tenforce/design-toolbox-button-push/blob/master/docs/_includes/components/toolbox-push.html).
